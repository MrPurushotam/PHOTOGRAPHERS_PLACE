            <h2>5 TIPS THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW FOR BECOMING PRO IN PHOTOGRAPHY</h2>
            <center><img src="Images/blog/1.jpg" alt="1ST BLOG"></center>

            <p>1. Set Up a Simple Studio
            As a blogger, you’re checking off your to-do list with the essential blogging tools you need to be successful. Those tools may include a quiet place to write, a website builder, and a social media account. <br>
            
            2. Use Natural Light
            Light is a primary element for any photographer. The right amount of light can drastically influence your images. When there is too much light, the subject in the image becomes distorted. When there is too little light, the subject becomes impossible to see. <br>

            3. Experiment with Different Angles
            Seeing things differently sparks your followers’ curiosity. Shooting a photo from multiple angles provides the reader with a diverse perspective.
            When you’re starting out, you will discover there are several types of angles. There’s the bird’s eye view, the low angle, the eye level, and the oblique angle. Don’t feel overwhelmed to learn every angle; your goal should be to try what works for your blog.<br>
            
            4. Add Creative Props
            A photo is more than just its main subject. If you’re looking to enhance your pictures, you’ll want to invest in props. The smallest addition to an image can make a huge difference.
            Relevant props spark originality. They also give the image more context and character as it relates to your text. When describing specific concepts, it’s better for your blog audience to see what you’re explaining.<br>
        
            5. Shoot Photos in Advance
            Preparation is key when developing unique photos for your blog. While some of your pictures may happen on a whim, your best work comes from advance planning.
            For starters, consider your editorial calendar to map out your photo shoots. If you’re publishing only carrot dishes for your food blog next week, you should plan to get several photos using the vegetable. <br>

            <h2>My Top 5 Interior Photography Tips for Bloggers</h2>
            <center><img src="Images/blog/2.png" alt="2ND BLOG"></center>
            <p>
                These are 5 things I do every time I take photos for the blog, and they have improved my photography immensely.<br>
                1. Create the Best Possible Lighting Situation
                One of the most frustrating things to try to figure out with photography– and particularly interior photography– is lighting. Natural lighting is ideal, of course, but it’s not always possible to do every shoot on a bright day when it is slightly overcast so the sun isn’t too harsh. There are a few things I do to help create great lighting.<br>

                2. Use the Magic Formula: Tripod + Low ISO + Long Shutter Speeds
                This formula completely changed my photography for the better. In order to get my photos light enough in our house, I used to bump the ISO all the way up to 800 or sometimes higher; I would also need to keep my f-stop low so that I could use a fast enough shutter speed that my photos didn’t turn out blurry. The problem with a high ISO, though, is that you get some grain to your photos, and they’re not incredibly crisp and clear. The other problem with this method was that it was hard to get an entire room in focus since I had to keep my f-stop so low so the photo would stay bright.<br>

                3. Learn How to Tether
                Tethering also changed my photography for the better and has saved me a ton of time. With tethering, I use the cord that came with my camera (the same one you would use to transfer photos from your camera to the computer) to connect the camera to the computer. Then I get into the Canon EOS utility on my computer and choose the “remote shooting” option. This allows me to adjust the settings and push the button to take the photo from my computer rather than on the camera itself.  <br> 

                4. Take Shots from Many, Many Different Angles
                When I’m doing a shoot, I usually have in mind the types of photos I want to take for my upcoming blog post(s). I don’t stop there, though. If I have a room or project set up for a shoot, I take photos from every possible distance and angle– close shots, medium shots, far shots, shots from all different sides of the subject, shots from above, shots from behind, etc. Not only do I end up with some unexpected “money” shots from these different angles, but having so many different shots of a single space or project can help me have the perfect shot for all of my different social media platforms, and it can give me weeks worth of photos I can post on Instagram!<br>

                5. Nail Down Your Editing Process
                Finally, I would say that honing my editing process has been almost as important as the actual photo-taking process. I started out by editing in PicMonkey, which worked well for me for a long time. I then took the time to learn Photoshop, and again, it was a total game changer. Advanced programs like Photoshop and Lightroom can seem intimidating, but once you have your process down, you can basically do the same thing for every photo and soon it becomes second nature.<br>
